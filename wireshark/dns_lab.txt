** server can't find iitb.ac.in: NXDOMAIN and tried www.iitb.ac.in, I guess I cant reach it, tried from 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1 dns servers, the didnt work out as well

5:
The request for the websites ip was firstly sent to my router, dns standard query was sent over via the UDP protocol. 

6:
The answer is in the next packet, sent from my router back to me, with answer => that my router does not support the AAAA(the dns cant answer the for ipv6), I guess my router cant work with ipv6, then it sends the A (ipv4); I have ipv6 primary in my interface en0, therefore the gate will try to proceed with it. 
But overall, answering the question, protocol - UDP

Router gets my dns request on port 53(well known UDP port) 
Destination port - 53;
Source port - 53;

The browser goese to the router and checks the cache for address, if address not there => doese another dns request and another until finds or give error. Then establishes tcp/ip, and only after that send a http get => server responds.

12:
Destination port - 53 , source port - 53

13:
Yes, the default local dns server - I guess my computer has a program that caches addresses. Therefore the local is my IPv6 address.  

14:
Type A(asks for the IPv4 address of the server to establish a connection with a website), no answers.
