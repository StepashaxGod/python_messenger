Wireshark Lab: 
UDP v8.1

1. 
Packet number 1; in the first udp segment the QUIC protocols message is transfered - transport protocol for the http 3, which works above the udp on port 443.8 bytes of headers 4 fields, Source port, Destination port, length, checksum. 

2:
2 bytes

3:
Payload + header 8 bytes = length, in my case payload =37 => 45 is the length.

4:
Max payload = 65527 byte

5:
65535

6:
17

7:
Packet 16
Source port 52600 dest - 443 , packet - 17, source port 443, dest port 52600, udp sets the  connection between both, thats why it's changed.
